# Magento Example Modules

Each subdirectory of this repository is a magento module which is intended to
be used for learning how to do different things in Magento. I learn far more by
looking at examples than I do by reading docs and tutorials, so this is my
attempt to make learning Magento easier.

To install each module, simply copy the contents of a subdirectory into your
Magento root.

Cheers!
